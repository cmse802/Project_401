Abstract:
	Tensorflow is an open-source software library that works with machine learning. This program
	allows for the creation of both simple and complex models. It is largely known for it's use
	when creating neural network models. These models are extremely useful in predicting what
	classes specific images can be apart of. Models such as these are similar to what is used
	when, for example, investigators look through a database of faces and need to find a specific
	individual. While tensorflow can be used for elaborate models such as these, it can also be
	used on simple stats prediction models. For instance, if one was given a dataset of flower
	information, than they could create a simple model that could predict what type of flower it
	is based off of the information. Though this type of model is not as advanced as the face
	database one, they both can be very effective.
